# Demography

Here we investigate the effect of population age structure and size on the spread of the epidemic.

The analysis is performed using Julia in a jupyter notebook.

In "Serological Shields Demography US States.ipynb" we show differences in epidemic spread for different US states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.

The following outputs correspond to Fig S2 and FigS3 in the supporting information:
